# Gloog &ndash; Math

This crate holds mathematical data structures and functions for use with
_Gloog_. At the moment, that's just matrices (`Mat2`, `Mat3`, and `Mat4`) and
vectors (`Vec2`, `Vec3`, and `Vec4`). This crate does its best to provide good
operator overloading and conversion support for these types.

In the future, `Quaternion`s will likely make an appearance, as well as things
like `Plane` and `Line` may be added with additional methods/functionality.
