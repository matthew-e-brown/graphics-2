# Computer Graphics II: reading course

I loved *COIS-4480H: Computer Graphics* at Trent University. It touched on some
of the most interesting content I'd seen up to that point at university, and it
instantly became my favourite course. Because we only touched on the basics of
computer graphics, the professor suggested that I should do a reading
(self-study) course in the following summer.

This repository holds all of the work that I do for that followup course.
