# Sources for Test Models

`cube.obj` is a hand-typed example from the professor in last semester's
COIS-4480H: Computer Graphics class.

## Kenney

All models in the `kenney` folder come from <https://kenney.nl/>. They are
licensed under the public domain.

## Cats

All of cats come from Free3d:

- `lowpolycat`: https://free3d.com/3d-model/low-poly-cat-46138.html
- `Cat_v1_L3`: https://free3d.com/3d-model/cat-v1--522281.html
- `Cat_v3_L1`: https://free3d.com/3d-model/cat-v3--351220.html

## Other

Other models that aren't in this folder, but that I might use at some point:
